# NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data Analysis ðŸš–ðŸ“Š

This project analyzes the New York City Yellow Taxi Trip Dataset to uncover insights about taxi usage patterns, fare distributions, trip distances, and other key transportation metrics. The dataset contains millions of rows representing taxi trips in NYC, including timestamps, locations, fares, and passenger details.

## Main Columns:

    tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime: Trip start and end timestamps

    passenger_count: Number of passengers

    trip_distance: Distance traveled (miles)

    fare_amount: Fare paid for the trip

    payment_type: Method of payment (e.g., cash, card)

    pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude: Pickup location

    dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude: Dropoff location

    tip_amount, tolls_amount, total_amount: Additional financial details

## Libraries Used

import pandas as pd  
import numpy as np  
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
import seaborn as sns  
import datetime as dt

## Data Cleaning

    Converted datetime columns to proper datetime64 type

    Dropped rows with missing fare_amount, trip_distance, and datetime values

    Removed trips with:

        Zero or negative distance or fare

        Zero passengers

        Fare above the 99th percentile (outliers)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Checked distribution of fare amounts, trip distances, and passenger counts

    Evaluated temporal patterns: hourly, daily, weekly trends

    Mapped pickup and dropoff coordinates for spatial analysis

    Compared fares and tips by payment type

## Insights 

    ~12.6 million records analyzed after cleaning

    Typical fare: ~$11.62

    Average trip distance: ~13.5 miles

    Outlier trips removed (e.g., fares > 99th percentile)

    Most common trips occur with 1 or 2 passengers.

    Cash payments are more common for short, cheap trips.

    Tip amount distribution skews right; higher tips are rare.

    Peak hours show surge in trip count around 8 AM and 6 PM.

    Spatial density shows Midtown and Downtown as top zones.
